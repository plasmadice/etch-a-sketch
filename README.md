This project is still a work-in-progress with additional features to come.

Works in progress include two additional versions of the page-
-Version where mouseover generates random colors
-Version where mouseover shades in black

This project gave me a deeper understanding of eventlisteners. That was especially challenging. A lot was learned here about how to manipulate the DOM with javascript. Splitting CSS/Javascript/HTMl also intruduced the need to debug. I use a lot of unusual methods to do things that I'm sure will be extremely ugly to me later.
